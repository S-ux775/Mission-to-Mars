# Mission-to-Mars

** Overview:

For this project we used Flask, Splinter, BeautifulSoup and MongoDB to scrap different url sites to get information from Mars to build a new web page with relevant information in real time.

** Results: (Please refer to Images)

Images were scrapped and captured at some time. At the time of this script, the images could not be loaded againg. Scrapping is acually performed but images are not returned to the html script.
